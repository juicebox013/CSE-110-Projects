## about me 
A fun fact about me is that I started my computer science journey completely blind of what was to come. As a high school student, I wanted to become a cool engineer that would build robots and make jetpacks, but my friends convinvced me to take on computer science as well. Consequently, I applied to be a computer engineering major and started to love coding bit by bit. Some other things about me include my hobbies such as :
* cooking
* baking
* gaming (valorant, league, steam games)
* reading
* **SLEEPING**

Another big thing about me is that I like to listen to music! Id like to say that I have a pretty large range of music I like to listen to because I am a "as long as it sounds good" type of guy. A ranking of my favorite musical songs as of right is :
1. 42 - Olivia Marsh
2. TV - MICO
3. MUTT - Leon Thomas
you can find a link to my spotify playlists [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/yzzj99egx2gf5twvij6xsq4ja?si=65caad5ab4744d83)

## coding experience/skills 
In terms of techincal coding skills, I have experience coding with C, C++, Java, html, and css. I do not have that much experience working in the actual tech field, but have participated in events that allow students to create projects of their own such as ACM Projects and DiamondHacks. For example, for the DiamondHacks hackathon, I helped create an interactive financial planner that aimed to help those not as well educated on financial literacy become more aware of their purchases. A fun fact about this project is that it gave me ptsd on lines of code formatted like `<div classname="help"></div>`. If you want to see a funny image I drew to represent my team during this hackathon, you can see it [here](/Users/justinnguyen/Downloads/emily code/part3_starter/CSE-110-Projects/ucsd-petr.jpg). 

## CSE 110 Goals
Here, I will place a task list that I wish to have completed by the end of CSE 110 ! 
- [x] join a project based team 
- [] learn how to work in a professional project based team
- [] make an interactice and impactful project
- [] become a better programmer in terms of writing backend and frontend code
